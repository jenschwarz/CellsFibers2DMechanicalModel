Authors: Tyler A. Engstrom (initiated code), Mahesh C. Gandikota, J. M. Schwarz

1. Place loops_and_lines_run.py and loops_and_lines.py files in same directory.

2. Create a movie_frames subdirectory.

3. To run type in a terminal: "python loops_and_lines_run.py".

4. There will be a number of output files including the total energy of the system as a function of strain, the total stress of the system as a function of strain, the total stiffness of the system as a function of strain, whether or not the minimization procedure was a success, snapshots of the system at each strain in the movie_frames subdirectory as well as other output files.
